can you please give me the items from the bill
give me the array of items where for each item
you have to give me it's name, price per 1 unit,
number of units purchased, total tax on that item 
and final total bill of that particular item

return response in json format
other than json response do not include anything since response is used
by json parsers

if given receipt is not a bill, you can return empty json array

if you are unable to recognize the value of any field for an item, use the following rules
- for name you can create contextual name
- for pricePerUnit, you can keep it as -1
- for quantity, you can keep it as -1
- for tax, you can keep it as 0.0
- for totalPrice, you can keep it as -1
use a separate field called warnings of type array and add appropriate message
