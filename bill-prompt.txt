you are given a bill receipt of shopping / dinner
can you please give me the items from the bill
give me the array of items where for each item
you have to give me it's name, price per 1 unit,
number of units purchased, total tax on that item 
and final total bill of that particular item
return response in json format
other than json response do not include anything since response is used
by json parsers
if given receipt is not a bill, you can return empty json array
if you unable to recognize the value of any field for an item use the following rules
- for name you can create contextual name
- for price, quantity, tax and total you can use zero
use a separate field called warnings of type array and include what you have done
