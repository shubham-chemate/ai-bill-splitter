# AI Bill Splitter

Split bills intelligently using AI and natural language processing. Upload a bill image, define who paid for what with simple rules, and get instant fair calculations—no more awkward money conversations at dinner, no more time wastage after shopping just calculate bill share.

## Features

✨ **AI-Powered Image Recognition** – Upload bill photos and automatically extract items and prices  
🤖 **Natural Language Rules** – Define sharing rules in plain English (e.g., "Alice paid for appetizers")  
⚖️ **Accurate Calculations** – Handles tax distribution and complex sharing scenarios  
🎯 **Fair & Transparent** – See exactly how each person's share breaks down by item  
🚀 **Fast & Reliable** – Built with Go for performance; powered by Google's Gemini API  

## How It Works

1. **Upload a Bill** – Take a photo or upload an image of your receipt
2. **Define Sharing Rules** – Describe how items should be split (or let everyone split everything equally)
3. **Get Results** – Instantly see who owes what, broken down by item

### Example

**Bill:**
| Item | Price | Qty | Tax | Total |
|------|-------|-----|-----|-------|
| Appetizer | ₹50 | 1 | ₹5 | ₹55 |
| Entree | ₹30 | 2 | ₹6 | ₹66 |
| Dessert | ₹20 | 1 | ₹2 | ₹22 |

**Rules:**
- Appetizer shared by Alice and Bob
- Entrees split equally among Alice, Bob, and Charlie
- Charlie had the dessert

**Result:**
| Person | Appetizer | Entrees | Dessert | Total |
|--------|-----------|---------|---------|-------|
| Alice | ₹27.50 | ₹22.00 | — | ₹49.50 |
| Bob | ₹27.50 | ₹22.00 | — | ₹49.50 |
| Charlie | — | ₹22.00 | ₹22.00 | ₹44.00 |
